## Security 

Security within the Secrets App utilises minimal overhead  by using hashing, salting and password management through Auth0. 

* Auth0 helps you prevent critical identity data from falling into the wrong hands. 
* Passwords are always hashed and salted using bcrypt. 

## Example grabbed using Robo3T from Database [userDB]
